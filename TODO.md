[x] Refactor the whole thing with better encapsulation (using traits and structs and impls, etc.)
[x] Add decryption tests to all the test_known_pairs() in cipher/ (check out scytale.rs to see what i mean)
[] Implement the Solitaire cipher (by Schneier)
[] Further inspect scytale.rs (still some work to do on that)
