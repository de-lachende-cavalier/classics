- [x] Refactor the whole thing with better encapsulation (using traits and structs and impls, etc.)
- [x] Add decryption tests to all the test_known_pairs() in cipher/ (check out scytale.rs to see what i mean)
- [x] Implement the Solitaire cipher (by Schneier)
- [x] Refactor once again (the methods of the various structs should take selfs as parameters (some of them, at least), also the test_correct methods should be more like the one in solitaire.rs (aka using different keys))
- [x] Further inspect scytale.rs (still some work to do on that)
    - [ ] There's something weird going on with test_correct...
- [x] Add benchmarks
- [ ] Add proper documentation (also, docs are only show for the lib.rs file (?))
- [ ] Optimize the implementation
